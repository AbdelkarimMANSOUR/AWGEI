Explanation of changes:
Improved form:

The form now uses type=“email” for the user field, which automatically validates that the email address is correct before submission.
The login button is now of type submit to submit the form.
Labels added: Input fields are now associated with label elements, improving accessibility, especially for screen readers.

Error message display: A basic example of error handling is included in the JavaScript. When the form is submitted, an error message is displayed if the connection fails. This message can be adapted to suit the backend.

Responsive Design: I've added a maximum width (max-width: 400px) to the login-container to ensure that the page remains well-centered and readable on small screens, while being wide enough on larger screens.

Points to complete :
The form uses action=“/login”, which means that the server must handle the POST request to this address.
You might consider adding a client-side validation mechanism to improve the user experience.
If you have any questions or would like us to refine certain parts of the code further, don't hesitate to let me know!
